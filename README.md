### The code in the script is written by me personally so to use this code I have to send you the initials, Thank you!
ArbBrutteAttack is a software shell script that uses several formulas from cryptography as well as the Ceaser algorithm,
which enables an instagram account to try many passwords and often the correct password is also found!
### Features
- Multi-thread (400 pass/min, 20 threads)
- Save/Resume sessions
- Anonymous attack through TOR
- Check valid usernames
- Default password list (best +39k 8 letters)
- Check and Install all dependencies

### Usage:
```
Download the Zip folder or just in terminal write git clone https://github.com/Arbin20/ArbBrutte-Attack.git
cd instashell
chmod +x instashell.sh
service tor start
sudo ./instashell.sh
```

### Install requirements (Curl, Tor, Openssl):

```
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

### How it works?

Script uses an Android ApkSignature to perform authentication in addition using TOR and rotating the ip address to avoid blocking. 
The script uses Instagram-py algorithm, see the project at: https://github.com/Arbin20/ArbBrutte-Attack
